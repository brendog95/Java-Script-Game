Java Script Quiz game for homework

For this activity I created an html file which would be updated by the Javascript code I wrote.

It is a basic quiz going through entry level concepts to JavaScript development.

When you hit the start button on the game it will initate a countdown timer of 120 seconds.

If you asnwer correctly you will keep going without losing time all though if you miss a question it takes time off of the timer so make quick and smart decisions!
